## About

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and Computer Science at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology with major in statistics and this diversity of skills allows for a dynamic and ever-evolving field, where there's always something new to learn and discover. I have always been fascinated by the potential of machine learning to solve complex problems and improve lives.
